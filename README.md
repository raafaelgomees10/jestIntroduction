## Introduction to Jest

This project was inspired by Fabio Vedovelli's course "Testar aplicaÃ§Ãµes javascript". The main goal was to explore and learn about automated testing in our code. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into implementing effective tests in JavaScript using Jest, a powerful and widely-used tool in the development community.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies with the package manager of your choice, and then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
